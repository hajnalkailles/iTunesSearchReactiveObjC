# iTunesSearchReactiveObjC

This is a simple application written in Objective C which uses ReactiveCocoa and applies the MVVM pattern. It uses the iTunes Search API to get results based on parameters like search term and limit, displays them in a tableview and enables filtering by title. The text change in the textfields, handling the enabled state of the search button, handling the button tap, processing the response of the network request and handling the filtering is all done in a reactive way.
